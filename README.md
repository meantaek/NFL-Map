# NFL-Map
Data Visualization project to create an interactive map of each NFL player's birthplace. 
Data Clean up.rmd contains code used to pull in the lattitude and longitude coordinates of each player's birth place.
player_birth.csv is the resulting data that contains the coordinates.
server.r and ui.r contains the code for the rshiny app that visualizes NFL data using leaflet.
